# Example configuration

This example utilizes the option to add whitelists and blacklists on startup of the pihole container. With this setup you do not need to configure pihole afterwards. The container is ready right from the start.

* The blacklists are taken from [firebog](https://firebog.net/)
* The whitelists are taken from [anudeepNDâ€™s curated whitelist](https://github.com/anudeepND/whitelist/blob/master/domains/whitelist.txt)
